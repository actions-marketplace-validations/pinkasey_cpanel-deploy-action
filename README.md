# cpanel-deploy-action
This actinos deploys a site to cPanel using the cPanel API,
by taking the following steps:
1. Tell cPanel to pull the branch
2. Tell cPanel to deploy the branch
3. Poll cPanel deployment status, until the deployment task is complete

To make use of this action, your site should have a valid `.cpanel.yml` file at its root.
